Hello!

I made a simple website generator(although it can output anything) with OpenAis API in python.

It outputs the contents into an index.html so you can run the website directly from terminal.

In my case i run it with "Python3 main.py && firefox index.html"

The dependencies are:
Python3,
wonderwords(for word generation),
openai

Dependency installation: pip3 install wonderwords openai
